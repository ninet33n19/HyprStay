- **`client/`**: Contains the complete frontend code, built as a standard Vite-React-TS application.
- **`server/`**: Contains the backend API, database schema (Prisma), routes, controllers, and services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (or Node.js v18+ and npm/yarn)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ninet33n19/hyprstay.git
    cd ninet33n19-hyprstay
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend (`server/`):**

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd server
    
    # Install dependencies
    bun install
    
    # Create a .env file for environment variables.
    # You can copy the example if one exists, or create a new file.
    # Add the following content to a new '.env' file:
    ```
    ```env
    # The database URL points to the SQLite file.
    DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
    
    # A secure secret for signing JWTs.
    JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-key-for-jwt"
    
    # Port for the backend server. The client expects 3000.
    PORT=3000
    ```
    ```bash
    # Run database migrations to set up the schema and tables
    bunx prisma migrate dev
    
    # Start the backend development server
    bun run dev
    ```
    The server will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Setup the Frontend (`client/`):**

    Open a **new terminal window** and navigate to the root of the project.

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the client directory
    cd client
    
    # Install dependencies
    bun install
    
    # Start the frontend development server
    bun run dev
    ```
    The client will now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

4.  **Access the Application:**
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.
    - You can now sign up as a "Host" to create listings or as a "Guest" to browse and book.
